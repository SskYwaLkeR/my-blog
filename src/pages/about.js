    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm Hrishikesh rai, a 23 year old recent graduate from RGPV University.
      I'm passionate introvert who loves building softwares. I first started
      writing code when I was 14, I remember I used to write code in blue java
      but I didn't last long.
    </p>

    <p>
      Years later, I started designing UI/UX for apps and websites, and it was
      really exciting for me. I then started building some of my designs into
      code and ever since then, I've been honing my skills and learning
      javascript.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I grow as a developer, I worked alongside with senior developers and
      designers who raised my standard for whats expected for any web
      applications, and through these experiences I've the opportunity to create
      memorable products which is not only easy to use but are also written in
      code that is maintainable and easy to understand. Also I'm seeking a
      full-time role where I can combine my skills that I gained and see how I
      will be able to contribute to the firm .
