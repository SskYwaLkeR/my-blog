### Javascript 101

Before I write anything I just want to let you know that this is solely my personal understanding of the
language I might be absolutely wrong about something but hey this is why you and I are here, if you find something
wrong just file a PR or DM me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Hrishikeshrai2). Now that being said lets get started.

**what is javascript**

Short answer, its a lightweight programming language.

**Javascript variables**

Javascript variable is just a bucket to hold values.

**Data Types**

In javascript variables don't have data type but values do, unlike other programming language where you declare
a variable using some _keyword_ like (int, string etc). Let's have a look into some of the _primitve data type_ in JS.

- undefinded
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Object
- Symbol
- BigInt

apart from these we have other data type as well. These are

- Object
- Array (Sub type of Object)
- Function (Sub type of Object)
- null
